# Plant-Monitoring-System
The New Blynk IoT Smart Plant Monitoring System uses the NodeMCU ESP8266 to track soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time. It can automatically water the plant through a relay-controlled pump and sends live updates to the Blynk app. A PIR sensor adds basic security, making plant care simple and smart.
